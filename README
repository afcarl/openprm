Read the wiki (to be added soon on www.makokal.com) for a more comprehensive documentation

To compile, run the following:

	[Ensure you have all  OpenRAVE installed, check openrave.programmingvision.com to see how]

	check out the source
	cd openprm
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ../
	make
	make install


	cd ..
	export OPENRAVE_PLUGINS=$OPENRAVE_PLUGINS:`pwd`/plugins




	You can test if this worked by executing;

	openrave.py --listplugins


	and look for the Planners in openprm.
